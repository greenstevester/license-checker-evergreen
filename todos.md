## Progress Summary

✅ **TypeScript conversion foundation completed!**

The initial TypeScript conversion has been successfully completed and submitted as PR #1: https://github.com/greenstevester/license-checker-evergreen/pull/1

### Completed Work:
- ✅ Full TypeScript build infrastructure setup
- ✅ ESLint configuration for TypeScript support
- ✅ Core argument parsing converted to TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
- ✅ Supporting utility files converted: license-files, usageMessage, exitProcessOrWarnIfNeeded
- ✅ CLI binary converted to TypeScript
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working successfully
- ✅ Pull request created with detailed implementation plan

### Key Achievements:
- **Build System**: Added TypeScript compilation with proper ES2020 module support
- **Type Safety**: Implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for CLI arguments
- **Code Quality**: Integrated TypeScript with ESLint for enhanced code quality
- **Project Structure**: Established clean src/ directory structure for TypeScript source files

### Remaining Work:
The foundation is complete. Remaining tasks for a complete conversion:
1. Convert complex core modules (index.js, licenseCheckerHelpers.js, etc.)
2. Add comprehensive type definitions for all external dependencies
3. Ensure all tests pass with the new TypeScript build
4. Complete end-to-end testing of CLI functionality

The project now has a solid TypeScript foundation ready for continued development.
